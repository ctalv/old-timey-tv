# Old Timey TV

A video complier that allows you to make a pseudo TV channel. A user can watch shows as if they were watching on a TV channel. This is to mitigate binge watching and allow for a nice background noise.

## Functionality

- Search your favorite TV shows (anything available on YouTube)
- Select playlists containing the TV episodes
- Order the TV episodes how you want
- Play through the episodes in a TV channel fashion, a different TV show for each episode
